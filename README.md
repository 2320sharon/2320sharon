# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Sharon and I'm a Software Developer
- I'm currently developing Python-based applications at the USGS, focusing on leveraging machine learning models to analyze satellite imagery.
- I am the lead developer of CoastSeg, a Python application that that utilizes machine learning to accurately extract shorelines from satellite imagery.
- I ðŸ’š python
- I've got a passion for learning, building cool projects, and open source software


### ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning
- Lately, I've been research pixi and Docker to make research software environments more reprodible
- I've also been researching cloud provider hosting solutions like AWS to host applications & websites I've built

### ðŸ’» What I'm Working On 
- Improving [CoastSeg](https://github.com/SatelliteShorelines/CoastSeg/tree/main) [![DOI](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.06683/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.06683)
- Creating repoducible environments for scienctific software
- Improving and building out software for Satellite Derived Shorelines (SDS) workflows
